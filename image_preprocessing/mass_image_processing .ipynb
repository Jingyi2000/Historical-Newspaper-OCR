    "# Mass Image cropping\n",
    "In this phase, the previously developed image cropping algorithm needs to be applied to all the newspaper images from 1942. Observations and tests have revealed that the majority of images require cropping due to the presence of content from other pages. However, the bulk scanned images vary, generally falling into two cases: one where the correct page outline is much fainter compared to other lines on the page, and the other where the correct outline is strong but overshadowed by even stronger lines on the page. For these scenarios, the former requires enhanced sensitivity in contour recognition, while the latter necessitates multiple iterations of edge dilation to make the image edges more prominent, aiding in clearer separation of the main part of the image.**(The algorithm used remains the same, but the parameters are adjusted differently for the two different situations).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core objective is to achieve the best cropping results for various types of scanned images while maximizing the reduction of manual effort in mass processing.**"

    "The ideal process is to execute the algorithm for the second case directly after executing the algorithm for the first case to get the correct result. The first case is usually not a problem because the highest acuity (a defined lower bound) allows for a uniform solution for the shallower contours. In the second case, however, it is difficult to determine an upper bound for interations since the content situation is different for each newspaper. For more complex cases we had to need to manually adjust.（It is recommended to store a backup to prevent operational errors.）"
